============================================================================

This disc contains a collection of difficult (according to our experience)
One-dimensional Bin Packing Problems. They have been collected from the paper
of Waescher, G. and Gau, T. (1996). All together, 
22 problem instances are arranged into 2 problem files.

The instances are listed consecutively.
Each problem instance has the following format:
"problem name"
   number m of different item weights
   capacity C of the bins
   item weight 1   # of items of weight 1
   item weight 2   # of items of weight 2
   ...
   item weight m   # of items of weight m




Brief characterization of the different problem files:



 wae_gau1.bpp:
   17 "difficult" (residual) problems from Gau  (1996)

 wae_gau2.bpp:
   5  "most difficult" (residual) problems from Gau  (1996)


*****************
Related to each problem file is a file (***.z) containing the corresponding objective
function values which have been obtained by


	FFD 						(column "FFD")

	MTP (BACK = 50000)				(column "MTP")

 	modified MTP (Gau/Wae 1996,BACK = 500)	  	(column "MTPmod")
