================================================================================

This disc contains a collection of difficult (according to our experience)
One-dimensional Bin Packing Problems. They have been collected from the paper 
of Schwerin, P. and Waescher, G.(1998). All together, 
200 problem instances are arranged into 2 problem files.

The instances are listed consecutively.
Each problem instance has the following format:
"problem name"
   number m of different item weights
   capacity C of the bins
   item weight 1   # of items of weight 1
   item weight 2   # of items of weight 2
   ...
   item weight m   # of items of weight m




Brief characterization of the different problem files:



 sch_wae1.bpp:
   100 "difficult" problems (ffd-hard, partially mtp-hard, n = 100,
                    cf. Schwerin and Waescher (1998))

 sch_wae2.bpp:
   100 "difficult" problems (ffd-hard, partially mtp-hard, n = 120,
                    cf. Schwerin and Waescher (1998))

*****************
Related to each problem file is a file (***.z) containing the corresponding objective
function values which have been obtained by


	FFD 						(column "FFD")

	MTP (BACK = 50000)				(column "MTP")

 	modified MTP (Gau/Wae 1996,BACK = 500)	  	(column "MTPmod")
